# Portfolio Enhancement Plan  

For my midterm project, I developed my GitHub portfolio with a focus on a clean and interactive design. Iâ€™m happy with the initial outcome but plan to improve it for the final submission.  

## Goals for the Final Version  
- Add an interactive mouse effect that changes the background color on movement.  
- Implement a custom scrollbar for a smoother browsing experience.  
- Introduce a dark mode option for better accessibility.  
- Embed project descriptions directly within the links instead of using plain hyperlinks.  

## Overall Objective  
I want to enhance interactivity and refine the visual design to create a more engaging and polished portfolio.
