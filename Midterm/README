For my midterm project, I worked on my portfolio, aiming for a simple yet interactive design. I was pleased with how it turned out, but I want to refine it further for the final.

For the final, I plan to:
- Add an interactive mouse effect that changes the background color as it moves.
- Implement a custom scrollbar.
- Introduce a dark mode option.
- Embed project descriptions directly within the links instead of just using plain hyperlinks.

Overall, I want to enhance interactivity and focus on improving the aesthetic to create a more polished and engaging experience.
