<hi> Vodka Pasta Recipe <h1>
<p> Vodka pasta, also known as penne alla vodka, is a rich and creamy Italian-American dish that combines perfectly cooked pasta with a luscious tomato-based sauce infused with vodka. The sauce is crafted from a harmonious blend of ripe tomatoes, heavy cream, and a hint of vodka, which helps to enhance the flavors and create a silky texture. Often seasoned with garlic, onion, and a touch of red pepper flakes for a subtle kick, this dish is finished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil for a flavorful and aromatic topping. Perfectly comforting and indulgent, vodka pasta is a favorite for cozy dinners and special occasions alike.
